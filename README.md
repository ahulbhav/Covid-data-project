# CovidData Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data from around the world. The dataset contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, collected from various sources. The data cleaning process was initially performed using Excel, followed by analysis and insights derived using SQL queries. Additionally, Tableau was utilized for data visualization to enhance the presentation of insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes COVID-19 data from different countries, covering aspects such as daily cases, deaths, and recoveries. The dataset is regularly updated and sourced from reputable sources to ensure accuracy.

## Data Cleaning
The initial cleaning of the dataset was conducted using Excel. This involved tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for consistency. The cleaned dataset was then imported into a SQL database for further analysis.

## Analysis
SQL queries were utilized to analyze the cleaned dataset and derive insights. Various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were explored, including trends over time, geographical distribution of cases, mortality rates, and factors influencing the spread of the virus.

## Visualization
Tableau was used for data visualization to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and charts. This allowed for a more intuitive presentation of the insights obtained from the analysis.

## Insights
Some of the key insights obtained from the analysis include:
- Identification of countries with the highest number of cases.
- Analysis of trends in daily cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
- Comparison of COVID-19 statistics between different regions and countries.
- Exploration of factors contributing to variations in infection rates and mortality rates.

## Usage
1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw dataset can be cleaned using Excel or any other preferred data cleaning tool to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. **SQL Analysis**: Import the cleaned dataset into a SQL database and execute the provided SQL queries to perform analysis and derive insights.
3. **Visualization**: Utilize Tableau to visualize the analyzed data and create interactive dashboards for better understanding and presentation.
